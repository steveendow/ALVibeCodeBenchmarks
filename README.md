# AL Vibe Code Benchmarks

I'm on a journey to try to learn how to vibe code AL projects for Business Central.

I'll try to share sample files to help new vibe coders learn how to create PRDs, use them with AI dev tools, and potentially use modern software engineering principles and practices to improve vibe coding results.

For now, I'm creating basic examples to get started and work through the technical and process issues.
